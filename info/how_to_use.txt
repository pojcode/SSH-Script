### HOW TO USE ###


Fill in data_file.txt with the data required
Save data_file.txt

You can modify parameters for pings and SSH sessions using .cfg file.

You can place configuration files in config_files directory and use that files as template to apply the commands contained in the file
(e.g in data_file.txt -> -COMMANDS: -> <file=filename.txt> -> script will take commands from filename.txt and apply them to devices)

A log_file located in logs directory will be created after script ends.
